# Car Fuel Efficiency Prediction

## Overview
This project aims to predict a car's combined miles per gallon (MPG) based on various factors like the car's make, model, engine size, year, and other attributes using a linear regression model. The dataset contains information about cars, including their fuel efficiency in city, highway, and combined conditions.

## Project Features
- Data preprocessing, including handling missing values and encoding categorical variables.
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations to understand the relationships between car features and MPG.
- A linear regression model to predict the combined MPG based on car attributes.
- Evaluation of the model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
